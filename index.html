        <h2>Who Are Imagine Dragons?</h2>
            <p>Imagine Dragons is an American pop rock band that originated in Las Vegas. They first gained exposure with their single "It's Time" and their studio album 
            "Night Visions." They have had chart-topping singles such as "Radioactive" and "Demons." They have been recognized by Billboard, Rolling Stone, MTV, and many more. They released their third studio album in 2017 named "Evolve" that contained "Believer", "Thunder", and "Whatever it Takes" which were yet again chart-topping singles. As stated before they are a pop rock band but some of their songs contain indie rock, electropop, and alternative rock. They are still on the up and up as a group and it can be easily assumed that they will be making great music for years to come.</p>
